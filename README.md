# scuffed-BB-tan
My attempt at making BB-tan
The "boxes" python file is necessary for the code to run. It basically creates all the boxes and saves images of the boxes
Note that this code creates a folder named "boxes" and saves images of the different valued boxes in manner "box1.png", "box2.png" and so on
The folder is emptied everytime the code is run and it updates every new round of the game. It adds a new picture of a box with 1 point greater health
